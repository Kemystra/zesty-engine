# Zesty 3D Engine

## A minimal raster 3D engine for learning purposes

The Zesty Engine is a CPU-based 3D engine based on the rasterization technique, a very common technique for realtime 3D rendering. The output is rendered through SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) in order to utilize its user input capabilities.

## Aim

Stuff to implement:
1. Linear algebra APIs (vectors, matrices, etc.)
2. Perspective projection
3. Ability to read OBJ files
4. Basic environment lighting
5. Navigation with user input (to be considered)
